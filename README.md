# Irrigation-System

in this project i tried to implement rest end points from my understanding to the PDF 
i was concentrated on application structure and using new features like spring data(through CRUD rebositories) 

also i used H2 DB in order for the person how will see this project can run on his machin without configuring A real DB 
if you want to add for simplicity you can use below request 

{
  "id" : 1,
  "status" : null,
  "area" : 4.5,
  "amountOfWaterNeeded" : 3.0,
  "timeslots" : null,
  "sensor" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "status" : null
  }
}


and also below are screen shots from my testing
